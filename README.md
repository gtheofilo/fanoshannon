The following project was made during the course of Information & Coding Theory at the University of Piraeus. The goal of the project was to create an algorithm that proccess the given text, perform shannon-fano circle coding on it and calculate some statistics.

We used Python as the language of the implementation and we tried to minimise the use of external third-party modules.
